This was my first website when i entered the field of web development but as you see things did not all that go well
All learners should learn to be consistent and determined about their goals so as to achieve them and should know that these goals are achieveable
When i started off with my journey, I was soo lazy that i couldnt even complete a class work given out by the lecturer yet it was to open up my experience in the field of web development
This is indeed my memory and i keep it here for reference to see where i came form and also monitor my progress
Thanks br to the founders and creaters of github which is full of resources for the developers.
